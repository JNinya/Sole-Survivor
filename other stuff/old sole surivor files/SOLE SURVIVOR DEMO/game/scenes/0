You find yourself in an abandoned facility. The lights are off and you can barely see with the glow of the emergency lights. There is a computer in the room. It seems to be functional. There is an exit door behind you but it is locked with some sort of electronic lock.

1: Log onto the facility's computer system
2: Turn the lights on
